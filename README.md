 Double-spacing, 12-point font, page numbering, and 2.5 cm margins on all sides.
 Proofread for spelling and grammatical errors.
 Documents submitted using other templates will not be accepted.
Referencing and Citing
Base theoretical knowledge in your answers and terminologies on course material.
 Use your own words for reporting other authors’ views and reference properly. Do not copy
and paste online material and other authors’ work in your document.
Direct quotations should be kept very minimal, in quotation marks, and referenced.
 For example, “Nike uses a product differentiation information system strategy because it
allows customers to use its online platform to customise its sneakers. This means that Nike
can use information systems to offer a different value proposition than its competitors (Smith
& Chang, 2010)”.
Provide a real-world example for Question 1, properly referenced using in-text referencing
and included in the reference list. Examples can come from academic journals, industry
journals, online newspapers, organisation websites, magazines etc. The real-world examples
must be referenced according to referencing requirements.
 The real-world examples should NOT be from the slides and our textbook, including
following companies: Apple, Microsoft, Nike, UPS, N26, Adidas, Walmart, MacDonalds,
KFC, Disneyland, Spotify, Zara, NBA, Amazon, Aldi, Tesco, Costco, Tesla, Toyota, Uber,
Airbnb, Facebook

 If the reference source anonymises the real-world company’s name, then you should look for
the anonymised name in the paper and use that. For example, company’s name in the
reference source is anonymised to ‘Company A’. You should use 'Company A’ from the
original reference source. Please make sure you also cite the reference source.
 Use the APA (7th edition) or another approved style as long as you are consistent across the
document.
 See Referencing Style Guides.
Academic Integrity
 Referencing others' work is a key part of academic integrity.
 Please see this link for more information on academic integrity
 Your assignment is checked by Turnitin for similarity with other sources.

The Case
Read the following case and the two questions. The questions require you to do basic analysis of the
case. You must base your answers and terminologies on the material covered in the first 4 weeks of
semester, focusing on information systems theory.
Note: Please ensure not to use the companies mentioned in the referencing and citing section above.
Case: EcoTech Manufacturing
Case Overview: EcoTech Manufacturing is a large corporation specializing in the production of
environmentally friendly consumer electronics. Unlike larger, more traditional electronics
companies, EcoTech’s approach emphasizes sustainability and eco-friendly manufacturing,
offering products designed with minimal environmental impact. Clients include some major
retailers and direct consumers, with engagements typically through large-scale orders and
partnerships with sustainability-focused retailers.
Company’s Challenge: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, EcoTech Manufacturing faced
significant challenges due to disruptions in supply chains and a shift in consumer behaviour
towards online shopping. Despite an increasing public interest in sustainable products, EcoTech
struggled to fully capitalize on this trend due to its traditional business model and reliance on in-
person sales pitches and trade shows.
Using Porter’s Five Forces, EcoTech identified competitive pressure from emerging online eco-
friendly electronics brands and larger, established companies. This prompted a re-evaluation of
their growth strategies. Although EcoTech serves a niche market of environmentally conscious
consumers, the growing demand for sustainable electronics presents a significant opportunity for
expansion.
EcoTech’s digital infrastructure, while more advanced than smaller companies, still relies heavily
on outdated systems for scheduling, client communication, supply chain, and inventory
management. They use basic ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems but lack integration
across all business functions. This limited digital adoption has hindered operational efficiency and
scalability. The absence of an advanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system means
client interactions and historical data are not optimally managed, leading to gaps in customer
relationship management and business intelligence. Similarly, supply chain interactions and
inventory management for components are partially manual, slowing down production timelines.
EcoTech’s leadership aims to evolve the business to meet current market demands and enhance its
digital capabilities. They recognize the need for more sophisticated and automated processes to
leverage emerging market opportunities in the sustainable electronics sector.
As a business analyst recruited by EcoTech, your task is to advise on the adoption and
implementation of advanced information systems. You will recommend information systems
strategies to help the firm modernize and leverage emerging market opportunities in the sustainable
electronics sector. Additionally, you will help the leadership understand whether to choose a
technology first or define a strategy first and provide justifications for your advice.
Please carefully read your two tasks and use the answer template provided to write your
answers.
